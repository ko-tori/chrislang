How to Chris Lee:

There is an array.
You start at a position.
Each position in the array stores a value, which starts at zero.

Usage (after adding /bin to path):

chris program.chris

Commands:

chris - move right
lee - move left
shift n - move n to the right (n can be negative i think)
chris? - if the value at the current position is zero, skip execution to the next lee? in the program, otherwise do nothing
lee? - if the value at the current position is not zero, skip execution back to the previous chris? in the program
troll - print the value at the current position as a number
ok - print the value at the current position as a character (based on ascii value)
lol(ol...) - increment the value at the current position by the number of 'ol's there are (eg. lol adds 1, lololol adds 3)
ri(i...)p - decrement the value at the current position by the number of 'i's there are (eg. rip subtracts 1, riiip subtracts 3)
rekt - set the value at the current position to 0
pls - set the value at the current position to an inputted value
gg - end the program
